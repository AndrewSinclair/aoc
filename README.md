These are my solutions for Advent of Code. I have been trying to learn _Clojure_. Please feel free to comment.

###NOTE:

I appear to have misplaced the solutions for day 3. I guess I reset the local repo before committing. I'll redo the solutions for day 3 before moving on to day 13.

###BONUS:

I have included an alternate Day 1 solution written in XSLT. It mainly uses XPath functions though to do string manipulation. I realize it's a bit silly to use XSLT for non-XML data.
